# California Housing: House Value

## Introduction
As part of the Introduction to Data Science course, we, as students, need to work on a
class project whose goal is to gain experience, improve our skills and run a real-life
problem using the principles discussed during the ten weeks of the class.\n
In this case, we will be using the dataset “California Housing.” It was built using 1990
California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the
smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a
block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).\n
The goal of his prediction project is to predict Median House Values.

## Methodology
This is a project implemented using R Studio and we followed the next steps
- Data Visualization
- Data cleaning
- Data Engineering
- Forecast using: Random Forest
