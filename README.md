Based on my experience working with different models some considerations of Regression or Classification models that can be used with Supervised Models

## Regression Models

| Algorithm | Type | Pros | Cons | How to Measure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
| Linear Regression | Supervised | • Easy to understand & explain<br>• Fast to train<br>• Good baseline model | Assumes linear relationship<br>• Sensitive to outliers<br>• Can't handle missing values | R-squared (R²)<br>• MSE<br>• RMSE |
